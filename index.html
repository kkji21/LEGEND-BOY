            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle
                royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company
                Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for
                other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under
                Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and
                scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was
                created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private
                testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with
                Jens Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms
                and is the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold and 126 million monthly
                active users as of 2020.</p>
